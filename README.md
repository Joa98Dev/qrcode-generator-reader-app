## Free Usage
I made this basic program with educational purposes, it helps me a lot to practice my logic and programming skills.

I relied [The Pyrhon Code](https://thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-qr-code-generator-and-reader-tkinter-python) as the main guide for developing this program.

Feel free to clone this repository, modify the code and make changes.
Enjoy your coding time! ‚å®Ô∏è
